<strong>Discriminating between 'original' and derivative Web content</strong>

Examples:
<ul>
<li>Spotting 'churnalism' by comparing press releases with news ‘stories’</li>
<li>Using search engines to identify exact phrase matches that might be derivatives or sources</li>
<li>Taking note of Creative Commons licensing</li>
</ul>
